Internal Groups and Areas of Focus
---------------------------------

Core is probably the big component in coala. Almost everything else is heavily
tied with it; so it doesn't make sense to have a huge, monolithic, and
unfocused team. So I propose to have a few areas of focus that each team member
can choose to align themselves with.

Please note that these are not strict teams. And by no means exhaustive. These
is simply a categorization to co-ordinate efforts better. And it is entirely
possible than an issue doesn't fall under one of the proposed groups squarely -
overlaps are allowed. In short, these is simply a way to organize better, in an
undivisive manner.

Performance
===========

I'm a sucker for performance and I like things fast. And you should too!

This group intends to improve on coala's performance. Since coala is written in
Python, there are some limitations to how far we can go with this, but there's
still quite a lot we can do.

Usability and User Interface
============================

coala is designed to be very user-friendly and we should work to keep it that
way. This means constant feedback, design and implementation. This also involves
coming with new and intuitive interfaces. Just like fashion, UI development
never ends.

`bearlib` Development
=====================

coala is nothing without its bears. This group will be dedicated to extending,
improving, and maintaining the library available to bear authors.

Supporting Tools
================

This was initially proposed as a separate team (informally). This group's main
focus is the development of supporting tools for coala such as
``coala-quickstart`` and ``coala-html``. This also involves taking care of
internal libraries such as coala-utils.
